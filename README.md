always liked the way that logic worked in computers, thought it would be great to make a logic circuit sim ...
riddled with bugs for now ... but ill work on it

as of right now, the way of checking if a data cell is on or off is that if a data cell or an input data cell prior to the current data cell is on, then current cell becomes on,
and its done with a bunch of loops and nested loops which is not the best way of going for it, and i encountered a f*** ton of bugs with it wrong cells turning on. i probably need
to make a sprite system instead of nested loops checking each empty cell on the grid in each iteration ...
